description: The History of the American West Collection is a unique project that
  provides opportunities for researchers and new readers to easily access and explore
  works which have previously only been available on library shelves. The Collection
  brings to life pre-1923 titles focusing on a wide range of topics and experiences
  in US Western history. From the initial westward migration, to exploration and development
  of the American West to daily life in the West and intimate pictures of the people
  who inhabited it, this collection offers American West enthusiasts a new glimpse
  at some forgotten treasures of American culture. Encompassing genres such as poetry,
  fiction, nonfiction, tourist guides, biographies and drama, this collection provides
  a new window to the legend and realities of the American West.
